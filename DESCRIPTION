Package: hydR
Title: Package for creating hydrological network inside forest
Version: 0.0.1

Description:
The **hydR** package supports hydrological analysis by automating spatial data processing. It provides tools for working with Digital Elevation Models (DEM) and analyzing flow and hydrographic networks, particularly within forested areas. Created by the Geomatics Section of the Forestry Students' Scientific Circle at the University of Agriculture in Krakow, hydR is ideal for hydrologists, geomatics experts, and environmental specialists.
